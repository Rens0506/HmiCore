/**
 * Mesh deformations.
 
<p>The core-logic in this package resides in Deformer and *Deformer. Deformer
is the base class for *Deformer and provides an easy way to create other Deformers
with the same base. All examples below given for Deformer are also true for *Deformer.</p>

<p>The DeformerClient interface is to be used by classes that wishes to be a client
to the Deformer (which itself implements the DeformerServer interface). Being a
client means that changes in parameters are being passed on and that changes to
parameters can be made. This relation between server and client is currently only
1-1 and is used in cooperation with the GUI parts of the Deformer.</p>
